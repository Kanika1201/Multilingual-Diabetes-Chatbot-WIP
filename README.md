# Multilingual Diabetes Chatbot (WIP)

ðŸš§ This project is currently under active development as part of an academic research initiative. The aim is to build a multilingual, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM based chatbot to assist with diabetes management using authoritative medical sources (e.g., WHO, ADA, CDC) and Diabetes QnA datasets (e.g., MedQuAD, MIMIC-III).

ðŸ“Œ Key goals:
- Personalized, patient-centric responses
- Multilingual support (English, Spanish, etc.)
- Integration of fine-tuned LLMs and RAG architecture

ðŸ“… Expected updates: More details will be shared after academic review is complete.

Stay tuned!
